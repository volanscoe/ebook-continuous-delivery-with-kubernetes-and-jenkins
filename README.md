## [Continuous Delivery for Java Apps: Build a CD Pipeline Step by Step Using Kubernetes, Docker, Vagrant, Jenkins, Spring, Maven and Artifactory](https://leanpub.com/continuous-delivery-for-java-apps)

This book will guide you through the implementation of the **real-world** Continuous Delivery using top-notch technologies that are in high demand by the best companies around the world. Instead of finishing this book thinking "I know what Continuous Delivery is, but I have no idea how to implement it", you will end up with your machine set up with a Kubernetes cluster running Jenkins Pipelines in a distributed and scalable fashion (each Pipeline run on a new Jenkins `slave` dynamically allocated as a Kubernetes `pod`) to test (unit, integration, acceptance, performance and smoke tests), build (with Maven), release (to Artifactory), distribute (to Docker Hub) and deploy (on Kubernetes) a Spring Boot application to testing, staging and production environments implementing the Canary Release deployment pattern to mitigate risks.

This book is intended for Java Developers or SysAdmins interested in learning how to build a continuous delivery pipeline step by step using Kubernetes, Docker, Vagrant, Jenkins, Spring, Maven and Artifactory.
